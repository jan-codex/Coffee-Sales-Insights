## Problem Statement

This dataset provides detailed records of coffee sales from a vending machine, created by the dataset author to support open data initiatives. It is designed for analyzing purchasing patterns, sales trends, and customer preferences for coffee products. This dashboard visualizes sales patterns by month, time, and percentage, offering valuable insights into trends and customer behavior.

In this project, we imported data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/coffee-sales a CSV file into Power BI for analysis and visualization.

**Objectives**
This project aims to:
1. Analyze coffee sales patterns by month.
2. Identify coffee sales trends by hour.
3. Determine coffee sales distribution by coffee type.


**What is a profile README?**: A _[profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)_ is essentially an "About me" section on your GitHub profile where you can share information about yourself with the community on GitHub.com. GitHub shows your profile README at the top of your profile page. For more information, see "[Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)".

   The branch will automatically switch to the one you have just created.
   The **main** branch drop-down bar will reflect your new branch and display the new branch name.

6. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
